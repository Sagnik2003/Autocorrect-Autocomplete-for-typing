A sleek Flask-powered web application that provides **real-time autocorrect** and **autocomplete** suggestions — just like a smart text editor or mobile keyboard.  
Designed to feel natural, intelligent, and fast. ✨

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Autocorrect:** Fixes misspelled words instantly and displays blue suggestion buttons.  
✅ **Autocomplete:** Predicts the next possible word based on input context (green suggestion buttons).  
✅ **Smart Interaction:** Works even after applying corrections; keeps the cursor active for continuous typing.  
✅ **Responsive UI:** Built with lightweight vanilla JS for speed (~90 WPM friendly).  
✅ **Modular Design:** Separate Flask endpoints for autocorrect and autocomplete logic.

## 🧠 How It Works

### **Frontend (JavaScript)**

* Captures input events.
* Sends requests to Flask endpoints using `fetch()` after a short debounce (~1s).

### **Backend (Flask)**

* `/autocorrect` → Suggests spelling corrections.
* `/autocomplete` → Predicts likely next words.

### **Response Rendering**

* **Blue buttons** → autocorrect suggestions
* **Green buttons** → autocomplete predictions
* Clicking a suggestion inserts it instantly without breaking typing flow.

---

## 💡 Customization

You can easily modify:

* **Models:** Swap in your own ML models (e.g., spaCy, transformer-based)
* **Timing:** Adjust debounce delay in `script.js` (default = 1000ms)
* **UI Theme:** Change colors, glow effects, or button animations in `style.css`

## 🧪 Example Endpoints

### `/autocorrect`

**Request**

```json
{ "text": "thier" }
```

**Response**

```json
{ "suggestions": ["their", "there", "tier"] }
```

### `/autocomplete`

**Request**

```json
{ "text": "I am going" }
```

**Response**

```json
{ "suggestions": ["to", "home", "out"] }
```

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

* Transformer-based semantic completion
* Multilingual autocorrect support
* Grammar correction (BERT/T5-based)
* Integration with text editors or notebooks

## 🧩 Quick Demo Workflow

1. Start typing a sentence.
2. Blue buttons appear for correction for misspelled words.
3. Green buttons predict your next words.
4. Click one — it inserts automatically, and typing continues seamlessly.
5. Suggestions keep updating in real time.
